//! # Hypothesys testing
//!
//! This module contains the definition for [Hypothesis] and some common
//! statistical tests.
//!
//! ## Introduction:
//!
//! *This section is a brief introduction to statistical concepts*
//!
//! In statistics, when we want to make a claim about reality, we perform
//! an hypotesys test.
//!
//! ***
//!
//! We generate 2 hypothesys:
//!  - The null hypothesys (`H0`)
//!  - The alternative hypothesys (`Ha` or `H1`)
//!
//! The **null hypothesys** claims that there does not exist any effect. Under this
//! hypothesys anything we observe is just a product of random chance.
//!
//! The **alternative hypothesys** claims that there is an effect and is usually
//! the one that we want to prove it's true.
//!
//! To do a hypotesys test we must:
//!
//!  - Have a claim must be testable using data.
//!  - Then we have to select an statistic that can allow us to test the hypothesys
//!     - The expected value, for example.
//!  - Then we need to know the distribution of the test statistic under the null
//! hypothesys (known as null distribution)
//!
//! Here we can take 2 approaches: selecting a significance level (denoted by
//! `alpha`) or using the p value.
//!
//! ### Using the significance level
//!
//! The significance level (denoted by `alpha`) is the probability of commiting
//! a Type 1 error. In other words, `alpha` is probability of accepting `Ha`
//! given `H0` is true:
//!
//!  > alpha = P( Rejecting H0 | H0 is true )
//!
//! `alpha` is a probability that we choose wich is defined as the maximum
//! accptable rate of type 1 error. That means that when we reject `H0` we also
//! accept the possibility of being wrong one every `1/alpha` times. Common values
//! for `alpha` are `0.05` and `0.01`. Smaller values means less probability of
//! being wrong but comes at a cost of more sample size of less power (failing to reject
//! `H0` when it was actually false).
//!
//! When we select a certain significance level (`alpha`) we can generate a certain
//! conficence interval of the null distribution. The interval is designed in such
//! a way that there is a `1 - alpha` chance of the statistic falling inside the
//! interval assuming `H0`. In other words, there is `alpha` chance of getting a
//! statistic so *extreme* that actaually falls outside the confidence interval.
//!
//! If our statistic falls outside the confidence interval, it means that probably
//! it comes from some other distribution. Wich means that the null hypothesys `H0`
//! is probably false and we can **reject the null hypotesys**.
//!
//! On the other hand, if the statistic falls inside the confidence interval, means
//! that our data supports the null hypothesys `H0`. In that case we **fail to reject
//! the null hypothesys**.
//!
//! ### Using the P value
//!
//! The P value is a number that intends to summarize all the information
//! requiered to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesys `H0`. The P
//! value can be interpreted on the following (equivalent ways):
//!  - The probability of the null distribution generating a statistic
//! as extreme or more than the one obtained.
//!  - The value for alpha that makes the statistic lay on the boundary of the
//! confidence interval.
//!      - That means that if we use the significance level approach and we select
//!         `alpha < p` we will fail to reject `H0` and `p < alpha` we will
//!         reject `H0`.
//!
//! If we obtain a very extreme P value, we can forget about the significance
//! level (wich usually is an arvitrary value choice) and jump to the รง
//! conclusions immidiately:
//!  - If the P value is **very small** (for example `P < 0.01`) => reject `H0`.
//!  - If the P value is **very large** (for example `0.1 < p`) => fail to reject `H0`.
//!
//!
